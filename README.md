# Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains implementations of various software design patterns using Python. Each pattern is implemented in its own file and includes sample usage.

## Patterns Included

### 🕵️ Observer Pattern
- **File**: `observer_pattern.py`
- **Description**: Demonstrates how objects (observers) can subscribe to another object (subject) and get notified of changes.

### ⛓ Chain of Responsibility
- **File**: `chain_of_responsibility.py`
- **Description**: Allows a request to pass through a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.

### 🧠 Memento Pattern
- **File**: `memento.py`
- **Description**: Allows saving and restoring the state of an object without violating encapsulation.

### 🧮 Strategy Pattern
- **File**: `strategy.py`
- **Description**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime by encapsulating different strategies.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently:

```bash
python observer_pattern.py
